# Openstudio_measures
The following repository contains an Openstudio measure for the modelling of the thermal performance and controls of a central electric thermal storage device, as part of a whole building energy simulation in EnergyPlus. Please refer to the "Instructions_Openstudio" file for further details. This work has been developped as part of a graduate research project at the Ecole de technologie supérieure (ETS) and the Laboratoire des technologies de l'énergie (LTE) of Hydro-Québec.
